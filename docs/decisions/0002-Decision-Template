## Context and Problem Statement
Choosing the template for Architectural Decision Records for the project


## Decision Drivers

Need to have a decisions document to keep track of all the changes and decision made to the project

## Considered Options

* Lightweight ADR
* MADR 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: MADR, because
MADR was the most robust option out of the two, ADR seemed too lightweight and not enough details. MADR is easy to use and visualise with an opportunity to 
add more specific detail


### Consequences

* Good, because the accuracy of what is being portrayed will be very good
* Bad, because it was slightly difficult to set up and understand what it is that is being set up


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### ADR

Good, because lightweight
Good, because easier to understand 
Bad, because does not give an enough of an opportunity to be detailed


### MADR

MADR template | MADR template | https://github.com/adr/madr |

 Good, because it allows the architectural decision to be portrayed very clearly and accurately
 Bad, because faced difficulties setting up
