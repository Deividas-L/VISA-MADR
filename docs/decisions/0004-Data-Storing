## Context and Problem Statement

Finding the correct way of storing data

## Decision Drivers

* Security on the data must be strong
* Large amounts of data requires efficiency
* Large amounts of data requires 

## Considered Options

* Relational Database
* Non-Relational Database
* File System

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Relational Database, because
it is structured and is meeting the criteria of reading and writing to it, with complex queries included available if ever necessary. It is also widely
accepted and used, meeting the ACID property

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Relational

* Good, because allows read and write functionality
* Good, because it is structured
* Good, because it stores specific types of data
* Good, because the data is very strict and will therefore be accurate
* Bad, because can be difficult to maintain with large amount of data
* Bad, because can become slower with large data

### Non-Relational Database

* Good, because can handle many read queries
* Good, because can store many different data types
* Bad, because it is non relational, can make it difficult to make accurate queries
* Bad, because lack of ACID

### File System


* Good, because can have a file for each student, encapsulation
* Bad, because can become very messy and difficult to manage
* Bad, because will be slow due to having to fetch many different files
* Bad, because lack of ACID
