## Context and Problem Statement

Finding the best way to conduct a user evaluation with a prototype

## Decision Drivers

* User evaluation methods can vary and give different results

## Considered Options

* Lab Evalutation
* Interview
* Guerilla

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Lab Evalutation, because
it will allow users to get a feel for the application, and give accurate results and feedback


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Lab Evalutation

* Good, because allows users to get a good look at application
* Good, because allows users to give specific and tailored feedback
* Good, because can choose what is measured and recorded during the lab evaluation
* Bad, because the tasks are pre-set, so the users will behave in an expected way

### Interview

* Good, because can get an indepth response from each person
* Good, because questions can be customised to fit the needs of the evaluation
* Bad, because an interview needs to be accompanied with something

### Guerilla

* Good, because cheap and fast
* Good, as the method usually has an informal atmosphere the users could feel more comfortable and relaxed
* Bad, because the audience can be innacurate
* Bad, because it can have interruptions
