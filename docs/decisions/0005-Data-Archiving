## Context and Problem Statement

Finding the correct way of archiving data

## Decision Drivers

* Large amounts of data will be accumulated over the years which will need archiving
* Data does not need to be immediatly accessed

## Considered Options

* Relational Database
* Non-Relational Database
* File System

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: File System, because
the data does not need to be accessed often, so a cheaper and better alternative than hosting a whole database


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Relational

* Good, because allows read and write functionality
* Good, because it is structured
* Good, because it stores specific types of data
* Good, because the data is very strict and will therefore be accurate
* Bad, because can be difficult to maintain with large amount of data
* Bad, because can become slower with large data

### Non-Relational Database

* Good, because can handle many read queries
* Good, because can store many different data types
* Bad, because it is non relational, can make it difficult to make accurate queries
* Bad, because lack of ACID

### File System


* Good, because can have a file for each student, encapsulation
* Bad, because can become very messy and difficult to manage
* Bad, because will be slow due to having to fetch many different files
* Bad, because lack of ACID
