Choice of version control throughout the project


## Decision Drivers

Need to make a decision so that the project has version control
No version control can make the project messy to work on

## Considered Options

GitHub
OneDrive
Azure DevOps

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Azure DevOps, because
of the experience I have with it. It will also allow the project to be properly monitored and kept stable. Multiple people can work on it and through the power 
of pull requests it can be ensured that only production ready code is entering the main branch of the project. Branches can be made to work on different parts of
the application with disturbing the rest of the project. Pull requests can have tasks/user stories attached to it, gives development team a better idea of what
is being worked on/has been finished.


Consequences

 Good, because it is an easy and powerful tool that can be picked up by anyone
 Good, because there is a lot of support for it, questions can be googled if anyone ever runs into trouble
 Good, because it allows collaborative work to be done very easily
 Good, because automatic pipelines make it easy to release code to different environments
 Bad, because there is a potential that someone has not used it before


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Github

Good, because easy to learn
Good, because allows collaborative work without disturbing anyone else
Good, because pull requests ensure only production ready code is distributed
Goood, because plenty of documentation to help
Bad, because can be expensive to use if a large team is behind it


### OneDrive

 Good, because easy to revert if a mistake has been made
 Bad, because no branches option
 Bad, because no pull request feature, no way to ensure only production code is in the main code


### Azure DevOps

 Good, because easy to see history
 Good, because can attach tasks/user stories/bugs to pull requests
 Good, because can add automatic release pipelines to help with distribution of code to diffferent environments
 Good, because good UI allows user to learn quicker
 Bad, because can take a while to get used to it, if not used before can be complex to pick up
